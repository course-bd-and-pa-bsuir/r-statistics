1. Try to create a linear regression function for non categorial variables. For example, length ~ diameter + height
2. If regression is bad, try to remove outliers (graphical analysis shows a lot of outliers).
3. Try to use k nearest neighbours method to fill in categorial values (sex).
4. Remove all remaining rows containing NAs after previous steps (we have >4000 samples, omitting rows with NAs won't make a lot of troubles).
5. Check efficiency of selected methods by comparing statistical values of original and resulting datasets.

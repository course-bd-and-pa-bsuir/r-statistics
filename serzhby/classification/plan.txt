Dataset - data about measurements of abalones (sex, length, diameter, height, number of rings (shows aproximate age), whole weight, weight of shell, etc)

Data preparation steps:
1. Try to create a linear regression function for non categorial variables to fill gaps (NAs). For example, length ~ diameter + height.
2. If the regression is bad, try to remove outliers (graphical analysis of the dataset shows a lot of outliers) and try linear regression again.
3. The column 'whole weight' can be restored from other columns: shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight. Analysis shows, that 
	whole weight â‰ˆ k * (shucked weight + viscera weight + shell weight)

	where k = 1.05 is the median of [ whole weight / (shucked weight + viscera weight + shell weight) ] distribution
4. Try to use k nearest neighbours method to fill in categorial values (sex).
5. Remove all remaining rows containing NAs after previous steps (we have >4000 samples, omitting rows with NAs won't make much difference).
6. Check efficiency of the previous steps by comparing statistical values of original and resulting datasets.
7. Also try to simply remove rows with NAs from the original dataset. Then comare results with results from step 6. Choose the best approach.
